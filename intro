Hello,

Join us for a presentation on Neuro Symbolic AI with Lydia Webber and Omar Jagana, featuring a live demo.

We'll walk you through the development of AI, focusing on Neuro Symbolic AI, which combines neural networks with symbolic reasoning. See how this approach addresses the limits of traditional AI by mixing the learning skills of neural networks with the rule-based logic of symbolic AI.

Learn why this combination is crucial for enhancing AI's capabilities, explore the latest design concepts, and discover how Neuro Symbolic AI is making AI models clearer and more accountable. This session offers valuable insights and practical tips for anyone looking to build trust and understanding in AI systems.
